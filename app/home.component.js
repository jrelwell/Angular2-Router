Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Isn't that fantastic? Maybe there's a little something happening right here. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.</p>\n\n<p>You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. You can do it. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.</p>\n\n<p>Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. You can create anything that makes you happy.</p>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                        <h2>Tap, Tap, Tap</h2>\n                        <p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Every time you practice, you learn more. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Use your imagination, let it go. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.</p>\n\n<p>We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. In your world you can create anything you desire.</p>\n\n<p>Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. This is the fun part</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                "
